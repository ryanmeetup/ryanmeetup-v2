 * pile of ternaries at each call site.
 *

 * dialog measurement but a statement about how much room the form needs, which
 * an editor already raises when its supporting details open beside the fields.
 * A page that dropped it kept a fixed column and crushed that second column

 * One editor, two surfaces: the shared `Modal` on desktop and
 * `EditorPageSurface` on the dedicated route. Every Tier 1 editor renders
 * through this so the choice is made in exactly one place per editor, and so
 * the form body never has to know which surface it landed in.
 *
 * The two surfaces are genuinely different screens, not the same dialog with a
 * wider card. A dialog is a layer: it dims what it covers, caps its height,
 * scrolls inside itself, and closes. A route is the screen: it is titled with
 * `PageHeader`, sits in a breadcrumb trail, scrolls with the document, and
 * carries its commit actions alongside the fields they save. Only the form body
 * is shared. See `docs/MOBILE_EDITOR_SURFACES.md`.
 *
 * The dialog-shaped props — `panelClassName`, `closable` — are ignored on the
 * page branch; `size` is honoured on both. The page-shaped `parents`/`crumb`
 * are required on the page branch so no route can ship without its place in the
 * trail.
