# Mobile editor surfaces

Audit date: 2026-09-03
Revised: 2026-09-04 — the Tier 1 routes are real pages, not dialogs on a route.
Status: Tier 1 shipped. Tier 2 and the open questions below are not started.

Every create/edit flow in the Tasks app was a `Modal`. On a phone the shared
dialog caps itself at `max-h-[min(42rem, 100dvh − safe-area insets)]`, pads the
body with `p-6`, and keeps a `shrink-0` header and footer. Nothing overflows —
`Modal` has always handled `dvh` sizing, safe-area insets, an internal scroll
container, and a "Scroll for more" affordance — but on a 390×844 screen with a
stacked footer and the virtual keyboard raised, the largest editors were left
with under 200px of usable form area.

The fix is not a bigger dialog. The largest editors are laid out as two columns
(`lg:grid-cols-[minmax(0,1.05fr)_minmax(0,0.95fr)]` in
`components/resources/ExpandableResourceEditor.tsx`) and widen from `lg` to
`2xl` when their supporting details expand. Below `lg` that grid collapses to a
single column, so on a phone the expand gesture buys nothing and only doubles
the scroll length inside a fixed-height box.

## What shipped: the Tier 1 editors

The five heaviest editors now have dedicated routes. Contacts use those routes
at every viewport; desktop still opens a dialog for the other four editors.

| Editor | Route | Desktop behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Task | `/task/new`, `/task/[key]/edit` | `TaskEditor` |
| Project | `/projects/new`, `/projects/[id]/edit` | `ProjectsModal` |
| Category | `/categories/new`, `/categories/[id]/edit` | `CategoriesModal` |
| Contact | `/contacts/new`, `/contacts/[contact]/edit` | Uses the route |
| Calendar event | `/calendar/event/new`, `/calendar/event/[id]/edit` | `CalendarEventEditorModal` |

### How it works

`EditorSurface` in `components/global/` picks the surface, and it is the only
file that knows there are two. `presentation: "modal"` renders the shared
`Modal`; `presentation: "page"` renders `EditorPageSurface`. Both take the same
`formId`/`onSubmit` contract, so an editor's form body is written once and does
not know which surface it landed in.

The two surfaces are genuinely different screens. The first version of this work
made the page branch render `Modal`'s own chrome — a bordered card with a close
control in its corner and a sticky action bar — which is a dialog wearing a URL.
A dialog is a layer over something else, so it dims a backdrop, caps its own
height, scrolls inside a card, and offers a control whose only job is to reveal
what it covered. A route covers nothing. So `EditorPageSurface` builds a page:

- a **compact breadcrumb trail** back to the editor's list, in place of the
  dialog's close button — the trail says where you are, which a close button
  cannot;
- the same **`PageHeader`** every other workspace screen uses, with the title as
  a real `h1` and a one-line description under it;
- the form in **`Card` sections** that scroll with the document, so the browser's
  own URL-bar collapse gives the form the whole viewport;
- the **commit actions in the card**, under the fields they save, rather than
  pinned above them;
- a **column that widens with the form**. `size` is the one dialog-shaped prop
  the page branch honours, because it is really a statement about how much room
  the form needs: the editors whose supporting details open *beside* the fields
  already raise it, and `EditorPageSurface` reads it off its own scale — the
  dialog's rungs shifted one wider, since a page has no backdrop to leave room
  for. A page that dropped it kept a fixed column and crushed the two-column
  grid into the width one column needed.

`components/contacts/ContactEditor.tsx` is the reference composition. It builds
this shape directly rather than through `EditorSurface`, because it is the one
editor whose action row moves between sections — with an existing contact the
actions sit with the fields most often edited, above a People list that can run
long; on a new contact everything is new, so they go last. Keep the two in step
by eye: same trail, same header, same cards.

Contacts use their route at every viewport. The other four editors keep the
mobile-page/desktop-dialog split.

Three rules keep the dual-surface editors from diverging:

- **The form body never knows which surface it is in.** If a field needs to
  know, that is a layout concern and belongs in the surface, not the field.
- **The breakpoint is CSS, never JavaScript.** Triggers render an anchor that
  is visible below `sm` and a button that is visible from `sm` up, both always
  mounted. There is no `matchMedia` in the routing decision, so there is no
  hydration mismatch and no flash of the wrong surface.
- **The trail is canonical; the return is not.** `parents` names the screens the
  editor sits under — always the list itself, plus the record's own page where
  there is one. Where cancelling *returns* to is a separate question answered by
  `?from=` or `router.back()`, because the author may have arrived from the
  calendar or a project.

### Why the trigger pairs live where they do

The create affordances funnel through very few files even though ~9 page
clients pass `onCreateCategory`/`onCreateProject` down. `TasksSidebar` owns the
sidebar's create buttons and `WorkspacePageShell` owns the global new-task
button, so the mobile link/desktop button pair is written once in each rather
than at every call site. Per-row edit affordances are the exception and are
paired individually on the management cards.

## Tier 2: worth doing, not yet done

Ranked by how much a phone user suffers today.

### 1. Note editor — `components/notes/NoteModal.tsx` (215 lines, size `lg`)

The worst remaining ratio. A `RichTextarea`, `NoteLinks`, and
`components/notes/NoteComments.tsx` (276 lines) all share one capped dialog,
and `NoteComments` runs its own `matchMedia` at 768px inside it. A comment
thread nested in a scrolling dialog on a phone is the case a user will report
first. There is no `/notes/[id]` route yet, so this needs a route as well as a
surface — which makes it the largest of the remaining items, and the one whose
payoff is clearest.

### 2. Access group create/edit — `components/access/`

`CreateAccessGroupModal.tsx` (164 lines, 7 controls) and
`EditAccessGroupModal.tsx` (191 lines, size `lg`). This is the cheapest fix in
the audit: `/admin/access/[slug]` **already exists** as a real page, so the edit
dialog needs a mobile link to a route that is already built rather than a new
route. Do this one first if the goal is visible progress for little work.

### 3. Digest settings — `components/usage/`

`DigestCadenceModal.tsx` (258 lines, 6 controls) and
`DigestStructureModal.tsx` (241 lines). The structure editor reorders a list
with paired `IconButton` arrows, which are small targets for a thumb no matter
what contains them. That is worth fixing on its own terms — a drag handle or
larger touch targets — independent of the surface question.

### 4. Read-only detail dialogs

`components/usage/EmailDetailModal.tsx` (244 lines, size `xl`) and
`components/calendar/GoogleEventModal.tsx` (479 lines, size `lg`). Both render
long content in a capped box, but both are read-only, so there is no draft to
lose and no keyboard competing for height. They want a read view rather than
`EditorPageSurface`, which is built around a form; they are last because the
cost of the status quo is only scrolling.

## Deliberately left as modals

These are the right size for a dialog and should stay one. Listed so the next
pass does not re-audit them:

`StatusCreateModal`, `StatusReasonDialog`, `ProfileAccessModal`, `TeamDialogs`,
the four admin settings modals (`Banner`, `Email`, `Identity`, `LinkPreview`),
`ResourceAttachmentsPreview` (an image viewer, and correctly the one dialog
that opts into `dismissOnOutsideClick`), the two `CalendarPageClient`
day-agenda list dialogs, and every `ConfirmationDialog`.

The admin settings modals are small specifically because that form was split
per concern instead of being kept as one page-wide save. Do not undo that by
recombining them onto a page.

## Open questions

- **Draft continuity across the surface switch.** `useTaskEditorController`
  autosaves a task draft to local storage, so a task survives the jump from a
  half-filled dialog to the route. No other editor has an equivalent. If a
  future change lets a viewport change swap surfaces mid-edit, every Tier 1
  editor needs that autosave, not just tasks.
- **One breakpoint, three definitions.** `TaskWorkspaceHeader` and
  `NoteComments` use 768px, `LatestChangelogCard` uses 1024px, and
  `ContactsPageClient` uses both 768px and 1536px — all through separate
  `matchMedia` calls. The mobile editor routes deliberately avoid JavaScript
  entirely, so they did not force this cleanup, but a shared hook is still owed
  if any of that logic grows.
- **`GoogleCalendarControls` opens a dialog from a dialog.** Not a size problem,
  but stacked dialogs on a phone are disorienting. Worth revisiting if the
  calendar integration grows.
