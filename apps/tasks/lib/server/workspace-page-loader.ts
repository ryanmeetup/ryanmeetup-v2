 * answer — and one ownership check — per request.

 * database-backed workspace for fixtures, so a forged cookie leaks nothing, but
 * it would still walk an anonymous visitor past the login redirect into a
 * plausible-looking workspace. `is_app_owner` decides instead, and it fails
 * closed: any error, or any non-owner, gets the real app.
